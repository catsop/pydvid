DVID Client Implementation
==========================

Simple client for retrieving volume cutout data from a DVID Server.

For test purposes, a mock DVID server is implemented in the mockserver directory.
It serves up an HDF5 dataset over http using the DVID REST API.

For usage, see the tests directory.
